# Minting a PaperCat

In the [last chapter](../chapter-08) we looked at how to fetch and display Paper Cat data from its metadata server and up to this point we have only looked at a web3 contracts `.call()` methods. In this tutorial we're going to focus on minting your own Paper Cat and specifically using the `.adopt()` method.

## TLDR
Similar to other chapters, here is a [code repo](https://codesandbox.io/s/papercats-chapter-9-minting-a-papercat-3urk9c) if you just want to scan over what we're going to produce in this tutorial.
