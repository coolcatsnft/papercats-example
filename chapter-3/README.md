# Customising your project

Now that we have our react app initialised we are in a position to start customising it!  Your brand new react project folder should have the following contents:

<img src='../assets/chapter-3-default-files.png' />

After running `npm start` the React project encourages you to start editing the `src/App.js`, so lets start there.

Looking at the `src/App.js`, this is the code that is added by default by `create-react-app`:

<img src='../assets/chapter-3-index.js.png' />

Lets remove it and replace it with some simple text and save the file to this:
<img src='../assets/chapter-3-changed-index.js.png' />

Whilst we're here, lets have a look at the `src/App.css` file too:
<img src='../assets/chapter-3-index.css.png' />

If we remove all of the code from `src/App.css` and save the file, we should see the following result!
<img src='../assets/chapter-3-changed-app.png' />
