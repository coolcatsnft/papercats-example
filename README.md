This project is currently work in progress.  We will be adding step by step tutorials over time.  You can however, view the final code [here](https://github.com/coolcatsnft/papercats-example/tree/main/final).

## Prerequisites

There will be a considerable amount of code in this guide so familiarity in the following will be a major help:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Command line (linux, macOS, WSL or Windows)

You will also need:

- A Web3 wallet (we will be connecting via metamask in this guide)
- Lots of time to read!

## Aims of this Project

In this series of tutorials, we will be taking a user through all the necessary steps they will need to create a [React](https://reactjs.org) based application that can connect to a [Wallet](https://moralis.io/what-is-a-web3-wallet-web3-wallets-explained/) and call a blockchain contract.

This repository will guide you through the following:

- Setup an environment suitable for developing a [React](https://reactjs.org) based application.
  - [View Tutorial](chapter-1)
- Bootstrap a new site using the [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) toolchain.
  - [View Tutorial](chapter-2)
- Create your first functional React component.
- Expanding and structuring your codebase.
- Integrating a [library](https://github.com/coolcatsnft/web3-widget) to handle connecting to a web3 wallet.
- Listening to events from a wallet and reacting to them.
- Connecting to and reading data from the [Paper Cats contract](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/paper-cats-v1-1-beta).
- Minting your first paper cat!
- Styling your app.
